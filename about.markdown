Welcome to my digital space! I’m Dylan, a passionate software engineer and full-stack developer with a deep curiosity for programming languages, frameworks, and the ever-evolving world of tech. This site is an extension of my journey—an organized hub for my thoughts, projects, and continuous learning in software development.

Built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages, this platform serves as both a personal notebook and a resource center. Here, I document my challenges, share insights, and explore new tools and technologies. Whether you’re here for a deep dive into coding or to discover useful resources, my goal is to foster knowledge exchange and collaboration. It’s more than just a website; it’s a space for ideas to grow and evolve.
