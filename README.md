# dxdez

This project is a static website hosted on GitHub Pages, built using Jekyll to create a clean, user-friendly platform. The website serves as a centralized knowledge base, storing and organizing notes, resource links, and documentation for various programming and technology-related projects. It provides a straightforward, easy-to-navigate interface where you can quickly access helpful references, tutorials, guides, and other materials that support ongoing work or personal learning.

The site functions as a repository for essential links and resources related to different areas of programming and tech. Additionally, it features tutorials on a variety of subjects, many of which are based on the specific projects or topics I am currently working on. These tutorials are designed to help others, whether they're fellow developers or collaborators, to quickly get up to speed on specific concepts or technologies.

This static site is intended to be regularly updated with fresh content as new resources and learnings arise. Whether you're looking to expand your own knowledge or share useful insights with others, this platform can be used as a personal reference library or as a collaborative space to keep everyone involved in a project informed and aligned. The simple, efficient design ensures that information is easily accessible, making it a valuable tool for anyone in need of a reliable, continuously growing knowledge hub.
