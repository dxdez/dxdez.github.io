Exciting news for game enthusiasts! The site just launched **two new BETA games**—both fully playable right now, with further features planned for the future. Read on for details and direct links.

## Bounce Mallow

[Bounce Mallow](https://www.lytecade.com/games/bounce-mallow/) is a fresh **platform game** where players control a bouncy marshmallow through various obstacle-filled stages. The focus is on timing, reflexes, and creative platforming, offering both challenge and charm as you hop, dodge, and navigate to the goal. As the game is in BETA, player feedback is highly encouraged for shaping its next features and improvements.

## Tempo Stack

[Tempo Stack](https://www.lytecade.com/games/tempo-stack/) brings a fun twist on **stacking and timing games**. The objective is to stack objects as precisely as possible, but with a catch: the speed and rhythm of your stacking play a crucial role. The game tests your ability to keep pace and time each move right. Even in its BETA phase, Tempo Stack already provides a compelling mix of quick-thinking and strategy.

## Continuous Development

Both games are in early, playable BETA—meaning more levels, polish, and possibly new modes are in the works. Updates and new features will be pushed through the official [Lytecade GitHub organization](https://github.com/lytecade/). Players are invited to try these titles, share feedback, and follow along as development continues.

Stay tuned for future updates and get playing!
