### Introducing The LyteCade Project: A Centralized Hub for My HTML5 Games

I'm excited to share the launch of **The LyteCade Project**, a new initiative dedicated to showcasing my collection of HTML5 games. You can find the project on [GitHub here](https://github.com/lytecade), and an official website is currently in the works, coming soon!

### Why LyteCade?

As a game developer, I've always been passionate about creating interactive, engaging experiences through HTML5 games. Over time, however, I realized that the games I've made—and will continue to make—deserved a place where they could all be organized and easily accessed. That's where **LyteCade** comes in.

The goal of this project is simple: to create a centralized hub where I can not only showcase my existing games but also plan, develop, and release future ones. With my growing interest in game development, I wanted to ensure that my work remains organized and visible in a space dedicated to this creative journey, separate from my other projects.

### What to Expect

At the moment, the LyteCade repository houses all of my current HTML5 games, providing a place for you to browse and enjoy my work. As the project evolves, I’ll continue to update it with new games, features, and improvements. My hope is that LyteCade will become a go-to destination for anyone who enjoys playing casual HTML5 games or is interested in game development.

In the near future, the official website will serve as the primary landing page for LyteCade, with easy access to game demos, download links, and more. Stay tuned for updates as I expand and refine the project!

### The Road Ahead

As I continue to develop new games and explore different creative directions, LyteCade will be the place where all of this comes together. Whether you're a fellow game developer, a player, or simply curious about my work, I hope LyteCade offers something for everyone.

Thank you for following along!
