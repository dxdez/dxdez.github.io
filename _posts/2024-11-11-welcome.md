I am creating a new static site for posting my findings. As of now I am currently in the middle of moving and refining content on this site so that I can pick-up where I last started. I intend to try and post various findings and project information as I go along. I decided to switch to GitHub pages for convenience. Here is a brief tutorial if you are interested in setting up a site for your own account. 

Creating a GitHub Pages site from a user account and setting it up locally with Jekyll is a great way to host a personal blog or portfolio. Below are the basic steps to set up your GitHub Pages site, along with instructions for setting up Jekyll locally for testing before pushing it online.

### 1. **Create a GitHub Repository for Your Pages Site**
   1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log into your account.
   2. Create a new repository with the name `<username>.github.io`, where `<username>` is your GitHub username. This is important because GitHub uses this naming convention to recognize the repository as a user page.
      - **Example**: If your username is `johnDoe`, the repository name should be `johnDoe.github.io`.
   3. Make sure the repository is public.
   4. Optionally, you can initialize the repository with a README.

### 2. **Clone the Repository to Your Local Machine**
   Open a terminal and run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<username>/<username>.github.io.git
   ```

   Replace `<username>` with your actual GitHub username.

### 3. **Install Jekyll Locally**
   To set up Jekyll locally, you'll need to have Ruby installed on your system. If you don’t have Ruby installed, you can download it from [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).

   **Install Jekyll using RubyGems:**

   1. First, install Jekyll and Bundler (a Ruby gem for managing dependencies) by running the following command in your terminal:

      ```bash
      gem install jekyll bundler
      ```

   2. After the installation completes, navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository:

      ```bash
      cd <username>.github.io
      ```

### 4. **Set Up Jekyll in Your Repository**
   1. Inside your repository folder, initialize a new Jekyll site by running:

      ```bash
      jekyll new .
      ```

      This will create the necessary files and folder structure for a basic Jekyll site, including default themes and configurations.

   2. You can optionally modify the `_config.yml` file to personalize your site (e.g., title, description, etc.).

### 5. **Run Jekyll Locally**
   1. Install the site’s dependencies by running the following command (this will install any gems listed in the `Gemfile`):

      ```bash
      bundle install
      ```

   2. Once the dependencies are installed, run the following command to serve the site locally:

      ```bash
      bundle exec jekyll serve
      ```

      By default, Jekyll will generate the site and serve it at `http://localhost:4000`. Open this URL in your browser to see the site.

### 6. **Modify Your Site**
   - You can now edit the site locally. Modify files like:
     - `index.md` or `index.html` for the homepage.
     - `_config.yml` for configuration settings (e.g., site title, URL).
     - `_posts/` for blog posts, if you want to add a blog section.
     - `_layouts/` and `_includes/` for custom themes and layouts.

### 7. **Push Your Changes to GitHub**
   Once you're happy with the local version of your site, you can push your changes to GitHub.

   1. Stage the changes:

      ```bash
      git add .
      ```

   2. Commit your changes:

      ```bash
      git commit -m "Initial commit with Jekyll site"
      ```

   3. Push the changes to your GitHub repository:

      ```bash
      git push origin main
      ```

### 8. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   1. After pushing your changes, go to your GitHub repository in the browser.
   2. Navigate to the **Settings** tab of the repository.
   3. Scroll down to the **GitHub Pages** section.
   4. Under **Source**, select the branch to deploy from (usually `main` or `master`), and save the settings.
   5. Your site will now be live at `https://<username>.github.io`.

### 9. **Test Updates and Modify**
   - Every time you make a change locally, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to preview it on your local machine. Once you're satisfied with the changes, commit and push them to GitHub.
   - GitHub will automatically rebuild the site once you push changes to the repository.

### 10. **Optional: Use a Custom Domain**
   If you want to use a custom domain (e.g., `www.yourdomain.com`), add a `CNAME` file to your repository and configure your domain settings accordingly in your domain registrar's control panel. More info can be found on the [GitHub Pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site).

### Summary
1. Create a GitHub repository named `<username>.github.io`.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Install Jekyll and its dependencies.
4. Generate a new Jekyll site with `jekyll new .`.
5. Run the site locally with `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
6. Modify the site, then commit and push changes to GitHub.
7. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings.
8. View your live site at `https://<username>.github.io`.

That's the basic process for creating a GitHub Pages site using Jekyll! Let me know if you need help with any specific steps.
